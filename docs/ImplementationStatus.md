# AURORA Fluid Studio â€” Implementation Status & Completion Proposal

## 1. Snapshot (April 2024)

| Area | Documentation Promise | Current Implementation | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Simulation | WebGPU-first stable fluids with plug-in solvers (Eulerian 2D, PBF 3D, optional Eulerian 3D). | CPU-based Eulerian 2D semi-Lagrangian solver (`EulerianFluid2D`) with curl/pressure controls; single dye buffer; no GPU compute. | Missing multi-solver architecture, particle/3D solvers, GPU acceleration, collision mask integration, undo/erase painting. |
| Rendering | Full-screen quad with gradient/emitter/distortion modes, post FX hooks. | WGSL fragment shader supporting gradient/emitter/distortion & bloom mix; WebGPU pipeline with Canvas2D fallback. | No background compositing, post-processing stack, gradient editor UI, surface/perspective controls. |
| Editor UX | Tweakpane panels for global, sim, emitters, painting, rendering, audio, FX, presets. | Single Tweakpane instance with Simulation, Emitter, Rendering, Audio, Actions, Presets folders; minimal controls and default preset list. | Needs global playback/resolution toggles, multi-emitter management, painting tools, FX/post controls, preset import/export, quality presets. |
| Audio Reactivity | FFT routing matrix with gain normalization, limiter, band smoothing. | Microphone activation, smoothing/gain controls, single-band drive for primary emitter. | No routing matrix UI, normalization/limiter, per-emitter bindings, alternative sources. |
| Presets | JSON schema with multiple curated presets, import/export. | `defaultPreset` only; load-only workflow. | Need preset authoring UX, serialization, built-in set. |
| Tooling & Docs | Comprehensive docs suite + QA/perf plans. | Docs populated (Spec, Plan, Editor, Audio, Perf, Presets, Contrib). | Require implementation-focused checklists, progress tracking (this doc), automation for perf tests. |

## 2. Proposed Completion Roadmap

1. **Simulation Parity Foundations**
   - Modularize solver interface to prepare for future GPU/3D solvers.
   - Implement dye/velocity clear operations, pause/resume, and emitter brushing refinements (erase, force falloff).
   - Introduce collision mask data path (even if static textures at first) to unblock painting roadmap.

2. **Rendering Enhancements**
   - Add gradient editor UI (stop CRUD) backed by ParamStore; expose exposure/bloom in shader uniforms (done) and extend to background compositing hook.
   - Wire post-processing placeholder API so bloom/chroma/vignette modules can plug in later without breaking changes.

3. **Editor Expansion**
   - Create Global panel (playback, reset options, resolution scale) and reorganize existing folders.
   - Add dedicated actions for Clear Dye / Clear Velocity, and surface curl strength + dissipation sliders promised in spec.
   - Scaffold preset import/export (JSON download/upload) and prepare multi-preset registry.

4. **Audio System Upgrades**
   - Fix analyser buffer typing, persist smoothing/gain to ParamStore, and expose active-state toggle.
   - Plan routing matrix schema; introduce simple band-to-strength mapping UI as interim step.

5. **Presets & Docs**
   - Ship at least three additional curated presets aligned with rendering/audio features.
   - Maintain this status document alongside changelog; document testing/perf expectations.

## 3. Immediate Sprint (This PR)

- Deliver quick wins toward parity: clear dye/velocity controls, curl strength UI, audio store fixes, analyser type cleanup.
- Update ParamStore APIs and events to support richer editor interactions.
- Document status & roadmap (this file) for ongoing tracking.

## 4. Follow-up Recommendations

- Establish automated lint/test gating in CI once lint passes reliably.
- Profile CPU solver and decide cut-over to WebGPU compute or WASM for higher resolutions.
- Iterate on UI/UX polish with design mocks referencing Wallpaper Engine baseline.
